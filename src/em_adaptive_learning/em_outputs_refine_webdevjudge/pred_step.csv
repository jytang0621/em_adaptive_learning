Testing included: 1) Multiple attempts to create an active note through UI interactions (single-click, double-click on \'Neue Notiz\' button, keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+N, Ctrl+Q, direct text input) - all failed. 2) Browser search functionality to locate quiz-related text using keywords \'quiz\' (no results), \'smart\' (1 result found but likely referring to \'SmartNotes\' logo), and \'generate\' (no results). 3) JavaScript console commands searching for quiz-related properties in the global window object using keywords \'quiz\', \'smart\', and \'generate\' - all returned empty arrays. 4) Interface exploration through scrolling and context menus found no additional functionality. The application currently displays \'Keine Notiz ausgewählt\' (No note selected) and appears to be a basic note interface without accessible smart quiz generation features. The task requirement of triggering smart quiz generation for an active note cannot be completed as neither note creation nor quiz functionality could be accessed despite thorough testing.""}})\n\n\n",0,1,0.0,1,1,0,1,0,0.5,1,0.0,0.0,0.21243942555505935,0.5918897486401665
